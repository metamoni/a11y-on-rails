<h1>Images</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million</a>, an annual accessibiloty audit of the top 1,000,000 websites, missing alternative text for images is the second most common issue.</p>

<p>All images on the web must have an <code>alt</code> attribute. Screen readers need to be able to describe relevant images to users, and they can only do that if there's an <code>alt</code> text. Decorative images, on the other hand, are a hindrance to assitive tech users and should be ignored with <code>alt=""</code>.</p>

<h2>Images in Rails</h2>
<p>Rails' image_tag helper makes it easy to add images to your website. <code><%%= image_tag "icon.png" %></code> will generate the following HTML: <code>&lt;img src="/assets/icon.png" /&gt;</code>. To make this accessible, you need to add an <code>alt</code> attribute, like so: <code><%%= image_tag "rails.png", alt: "Alternative text" %></code>.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>To sighted users, the two images below might look identical. Screen reader users, on the other hand, will get a completely different experience.</p>

<h3>Without an alt text</h3>
<p>The image below doesn't have an <code>alt</code> text. Without any information to go on, screen readers will describe it as an "unlabelled image".</p>
<%= image_tag "bruno.jpeg", style: 'height: 50%; width: 50%;' %>

<h3>With a descriptive alt text</h3>
<p>For this image, however, the screen reader will announce the alt text I've given it: "Dog lying on his back, looking like he's smiling at the camera".</p>
<%= image_tag "bruno.jpeg", style: 'height: 50%; width: 50%;', alt: "Dog lying on his back, looking like he's smiling at the camera" %>

<p><i class="far fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden></i><span class="visually-hidden">Tip:</span> If you're on a Mac, you can test this yourself with VoiceOver. Press <code>cmd + F5</code> to turn it on, then use <code>control + option + right/left arrow</code> to navigate to the desired image. When you're done you can switch VoiceOver off with <code>cmd + F5</code>.</p>
